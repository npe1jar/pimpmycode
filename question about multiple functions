def build_sentence(xyz):
    return "%s is a benefit of functions!" % xyz

def list_benefits():
    list_not_an_array = "1 blind","2 blinds ","3 blinds"
    for x in list_not_an_array:
        print(build_sentence(x))

user_input = input("enter the user benefit ")
build_sentence(user_input)
#list_benefits()

PRODUCES THIS
enter the user benefit qqq
'qqq is a benefit of functions!'

and 

def build_sentence(xyz):
    return "%s is a benefit of functions!" % xyz

def list_benefits():
    list_not_an_array = "1 blind","2 blinds ","3 blinds"
    for x in list_not_an_array:
        print(build_sentence(x))

#user_input = input("enter the user benefit ")
#build_sentence(user_input)
list_benefits()

PRODUCES THIS
1 blind is a benefit of functions!
2 blinds  is a benefit of functions!
3 blinds is a benefit of functions!

SO WHY DOES THIS
def build_sentence(xyz):
    return "%s is a benefit of functions!" % xyz

def list_benefits():
    list_not_an_array = "1 blind","2 blinds ","3 blinds"
    for x in list_not_an_array:
        print(build_sentence(x))

user_input = input("enter the user benefit ")
build_sentence(user_input)
list_benefits()

PRODUCE THIS
enter the user benefit qqq
1 blind is a benefit of functions!
2 blinds  is a benefit of functions!
3 blinds is a benefit of functions!

AND NOT THIS
enter the user benefit qqq
qqq is a benefit...
1 blind is a benefit of functions!
2 blinds  is a benefit of functions!


ANSWER TO MYSELF: IS THE FIRST LINE ALWAYS OVERWRITTEN??
3 blinds is a benefit of functions!
